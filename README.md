# WavePatterns-Matlab
For my Scientific Processing in Matlab class, I wrote a script that analyzes fluids by determining the wave patterns for different fluids based on a given thermodynamics equation. The program will call the function calcWave which will calculate the wave pattern for each of the fluids based on the magnitude of the external force entered by the user, and the program will then plot the results and compare them.
